                In the SFC page, you can create and manage Service Function Chains (SFC)s. The SFC allows customers to chain distinct VNFs to create services. By chaining VNFs, the customer indicates the path which the network traffic will be forwarded to the destination network. For example, an SFC can be created to provide a security service containing a Firewall, a Load Balancer, and a Deep Packet Inspection. Thus, all traffic that arises in the network border will be forwarded along the SFC (Firewall -> Load Balancer -> Deep Packet Inspection) before the final destination.

                        Indicates the origin of the traffic that will be the input of the SFC. Two options are available
                        <ul>
                            <li>Internal: Defines that a VNF running on the infrastructure will send packets to be processed inside the SFC.</li>
                            <li>External: Indicates that the SFC will process the packets received from the Internet or an external network.</li>

                        This option is only required if the Traffic Sources was defined as Internal. The customer must determine which instantiated VNF will generate the input for the SFC.

                        Creates the path to define in which order the packets will be processed along the SFC. The customer must choose the VNFs to include in the SFC and click on Add. Then, the network interfaces to input/output must also be defined for each VNF member of the SFC.

                        Allows the definition of criteria to specify what type of traffic will be processed in the SFC. An ACL may specify, for example, that a TCP traffic with the destination on port 80 must enter the SFC. This can be specified with two criteria: ip_proto = 6 and destination_port_range = 80-80.
